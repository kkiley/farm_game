* Python School Project (educational)

I'm following the course at Python School -- http://www.pythonschool.net/
The real project I want to build is an interface for reporting on data in
the Roastmaster app that I use for roasting coffee beans. It's a great
iPad app but it is a bit weak on reporting at the moment.

I began this course because I want this application to be a GUI application.
I have no exprience developing GUIs in any language. While poking around the
web looking for help developing with PyQt, I came accross the Python School
course. It is ideal for me because it quickly progresses through python
usage that I am already familiar with but already forgetting, since I do so
little programming. The course covers some basic database design concepts and
the use of the python SQLite3 module.

From there, you are introduced to OOP, an area that I have only dabbled in
very superficially. When I think about it, I think the use of classes poly-
morphically should be ideal for developing the various queries and reports
I plan to develop for my application.
